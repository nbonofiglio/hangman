### README ###

Dear Reader,

WELCOME! This Hangman game is intended to be a coding project for a local startup. Doing this was a great experience, and I learned a lot (mostly through trial and error) about Node.js and AngularJS. Feel free to check out my GitHub and LinkedIn profiles if you would like to collaborate, or simply just to chat.

ENJOY!

### Rules of the game:

1) Player 1 picks a word at least 4 letters long.

2) Player 2 then guesses a letter. If the letter is in the word, the letter replaces the blank space each time the letter appears in that word. If it is not, the letter is placed in the incorrect guesses section and a piece of the Hangman is built.

3) If the hangman is built completely (10 incorrect guesses) before the entire word is completed, then Player 1 wins. If the word is filled out before the Hangman is completed, then Player 2 wins.

### Project Requirements
1) AngularJS for Client
2) Node.js for Server
3) Game logic performed on Server to prevent cheating
4) Keep wins/losses
5) Must be self-contained
6) Must scale to millions of users
